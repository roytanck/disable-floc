Disables Google's FLoC tracking for your website's visitors by adding a 'Permissions-Policy' HTTP header.
 
== Description ==

This plugin adds a HTTP header to your WordPress website that disables Google's FLoC tracking. The following header will be added:

`Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()`

If an existing 'interest-cohort' value is found, the plugin will not change that value or add an additional one.
